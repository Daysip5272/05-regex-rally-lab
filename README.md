# Regex Rally

## Objectives

Get comfortable using regular expressions.

## Instructions

Regex is awesome. This lab is test-driven so just run the testing suite to get started.

All your work should be done directly in the spec, `spec/regex_rally_spec.rb`.  You should type your regular expression in between the `/`s of `my_regex = //`.

## Hints
* Test hints
  * `matches character string`: match anything with **foo**
  * `uses anchors for matching`: matching anything that ends with **ick**
  * `uses ranges for matching`: matches any letter **a through f** _4 times_
* [Word Boundaries](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regexp_begin.asp)
* [Anchors](http://www.regular-expressions.info/anchors.html)
* [Ranges](http://regexone.com/lesson/5)
